# Van Gogh's Starry Night Power Spectrum Analysis

Background: 

Recently, parallels have been made between the Kolmogorvian turbulence (i.e. subsonic, incompressible, high Reynolds number flow) and the swirls and vortices depicted by Vincent Van Gogh, and in particular, van Gogh's The Starry Night. The Starry Night is of particular interest to the astronomer who knows that stars are born inside of turbulent gas clouds. If, by coincidence, van Gogh had depicted his starry night as being turbulent, this would be most pleasing. Previously, \cite{Arag2008} established that there were scaling relations present in the luminosity values of The Starry Night. However, a detailed power spectrum analysis is still lacking, which is essential to establish if The Starry Night is indeed turbulent. The aim of this study is to perform this analysis by to calculating the azimuthally-averaged power spectrum of night sky in The Starry Night. This will be essential for establishing whether or not there exists an something that resembles an energy cascade, with a Kolmogorvian power-law scaling, a driving and a dissipation scale. All of which are key features that define turbulent flows.
